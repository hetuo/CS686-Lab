1. Modified the loadDataSet function in Harrington's algorithm so as to read the dataset which columns splitted by ','.

2. Created a new class called svm_basic and it fit function will call Harrington's algorithm.

3. Wraped everything else in test.py. If you want to run my code, just clone this repo and run test.py

4. You also could run the ipynb file.
